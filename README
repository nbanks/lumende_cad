These are the OpenSCAD design files for the Lumend√© lamp.
Our goal is to cast the lamp parts in alunimum.  The prototypes
will use lost PLA casting, and the final design will use die
cast alunimum.

This repository does not contain any of the firmware or circuitry
required to make the lamp operate.
